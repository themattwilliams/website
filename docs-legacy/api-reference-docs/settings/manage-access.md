# Manage access

Depending on your plan and [role](../../people/roles-permissions.md), people with the `Owner` role for an organization (or `Admin` role on a project) can control access to Reference.

## Set up access to Reference

1. Log in to your organization in Workflows, and select **Reference**.
2. From the Reference page, select the Reference for which you want to set up access control. The **Overview** page is displayed.
3. Select the **Settings** tab to view the Reference settings.
4. On the **Settings** page, from the left, select **Manage access**.
