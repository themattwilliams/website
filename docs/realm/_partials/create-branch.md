Before you make any changes to your project, create a new branch.
This new branch is a place where you can make changes without affecting the published site until you are ready.
After you have iterated on your changes based on reviews by your team and the updates have been approved, you can merge your changes into the published site.

To create a new branch:

1. From the Reunite editor, click the name of the current branch at the top of the page.

2. Enter the name for your new branch, for example `new-dev-branch`, and select **Create branch**.
