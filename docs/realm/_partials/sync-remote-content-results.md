If Reunite detects changes between the remote content source and your project, it completes the following tasks:

* Creates a new preview branch.
* Overwrites the files in your project's remote content folder with the remote source content.
* Starts a preview build.

If the remote content folder does not have [Auto-merge](../setup/concepts/remote-content.md#auto-sync-and-auto-merge) enabled in Reunite, you must review the pull request and merge the content manually.

If Auto-merge is enabled and CI checks pass, Reunite additionally performs these operations:

* Creates a pull request to merge the updates from the preview branch to the default branch.
* Automatically merges the pull request.
* Starts a production build.
