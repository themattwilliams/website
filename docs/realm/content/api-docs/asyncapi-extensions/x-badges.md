# AsyncAPI extension: `x-badges`

The `x-badges` option allows you to add badges to an channel or operation, to use as an indicator in documentation.
The badges are displayed in API reference documentation in the following locations:
- the title of a channel or an operation in the header of the page
- the channel or operation item when it displays in a navigation list

Each channel or operation can have multiple badges, and the displayed color is also configurable.
