# `versionPicker`

If you have multiple versions of content, you can organize that content into versioned folders (folder names must start with `@`) and that content is displayed with a version picker UI element that users can use to select the version.
You can also add a `versions.yaml` file to set the default version and specify which versions should display.

The `versionPicker` configuration option allows you to hide the version picker or include the version picker even on content that does not have multiple versions.

## Options
