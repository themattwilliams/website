# `plugins`

{% configOptionRequirements products=$frontmatter.products plans=$frontmatter.plans /%}

## Introduction

{% $frontmatter.description %}
Use plugins when you need to add rules beyond the [built-in](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/built-in-rules) and [configurable](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/configurable-rules), or decorators beyond the [built-in decorators](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/decorators).
For implementation guidance, see [custom plugins](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/custom-plugins).

## Options

The `plugins` configuration is a list of paths to plugin files, relative to the config file.
You can include as many plugins as you need.

## Examples

A basic example of including two plugins from a directory named `plugins/` is shown in the example below:

```yaml
plugins:
  - plugins/my-best-plugin.js
  - plugins/another-plugin.js
```

Remember that you need to include plugins in the `plugins` section before you can use the content of the plugin elsewhere in the configuration file.
