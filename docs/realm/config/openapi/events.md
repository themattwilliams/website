# `events`

Use event hooks to get notified about various user events in your API reference documentation.
This feature provides access to in-page analytics.

{% admonition type="info" %}
{% partial file="../../_partials/config/_unsupported-redoc-ce.md" variables={"optionName": "events"} /%}
{% /admonition %}

Each event provides information about a specific event as well as some basic information:

```typescript
    eventType: string;
    resource: string;
    action: string;
    operationId?: string;
    operationPath: string;
    operationHttpVerb: string;
    operationSummary?: string;
```
