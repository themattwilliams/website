description: Extend an existing configuration set.

# `extends`

{% configOptionRequirements products=$frontmatter.products plans=$frontmatter.plans /%}

## Introduction

Use the `extends` configuration to extend an existing configuration set.
Multiple values are supported, and can include:

- the name of a [built-in ruleset](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules#rulesets)
- configuration defined in a [custom plugin](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/custom-plugins)
- a path or URL to another `redocly.yaml` file

Extends is useful if you use a common ruleset across multiple projects.
Define a ruleset in one location, and each project can `extend` it, with or without modification.

{% admonition type="info" name="Default ruleset: recommended" %}
If there is no `redocly.yaml` configuration file, the [recommended ruleset](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/recommended) is used by default.
{% /admonition %}

## Options

The `extends` configuration is a list of strings.

The list is parsed in the order it is defined, so the later entries in the list overwrite the earlier ones.

## Examples

To get started, try the following example to configure your project to be based on the [minimal ruleset](https://redocly.com/docs/cli/rules/minimal):

```yaml
extends:
 - minimal
```
