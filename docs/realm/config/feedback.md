# `feedback`

Customize how users leave feedback about your documentation content with the `feedback` option.
By default, the `feedback` sentiment form displays at the bottom of all Markdown and API reference pages, but you can customize or hide it.

The default configuration includes an email field for anonymous users to provide their email with the feedback.

The optional email input field is not displayed for logged-in users.

## Configuration precedence

Configuration for the `feedback` option in the `redocly.yaml` file updates all pages globally.
You can also configure the `feedback` option for individual pages in the front matter.
Front matter configurations take precedence, but settings from the `redocly.yaml` file apply when not specified in front matter.

Add the `feedback` option under the `openapi` or `graphql` property for API reference documentation pages.

## Localization

Localize feedback form text with `translations.yaml` files. Don't set text values in `redocly.yaml` when using translations, as `redocly.yaml` settings override translation files.

## Examples

### Sentiment

The `sentiment` feedback form displays by default on Markdown and API reference documentation pages.
No configuration is required.
If you want to hide feedback on your pages, you can [configure it to be hidden](../setup/how-to/feedback/index.md#hide-feedback).

Configuration:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
feedback:
  type: sentiment
  settings:
    label: Was this page helpful?
    submitText: Thanks for your feedback!
    reasons:
      component: radio
      items:
        - The page is clear, but not very engaging.
      like:
        label: What made this page helpful?
        items:
          - The content has great examples.
      dislike:
        label: What should we improve?
        items:
          - The content lacks practical examples.
    comment:
      likeLabel: What was most helpful?
      dislikeLabel: What can we improve?
```

      component: radio
      satisfied:
        label: Check all that apply.
        items:
          - The content was accurate.
      neutral:
        hide: true
        label: What can we improve?
        items:
          - The content lacks practical examples.
      dissatisfied:
        label: What went wrong?
        items:
