## Examples

The following example defines groups for the GraphQL items, and puts everything else under an "Other" entry:

```yaml
graphql:
  menu:
    requireExactGroups: false
    groups:
      - name: 'Cart'
        items:
          includeByName: ['/cart/i']
      - name: 'Products'
        items:
          includeByName: ['/product/i']
      - name: 'Customer'
        items:
          includeByName: ['/customer/i']
      - name: 'Company'
        items:
          includeByName: ['/company/i']
      - name: 'Gift'
        items:
          includeByName: ['/gift/i']
    otherItemsGroupName: 'Other'
```

With this configuration in place, the sidebar shows the cart, product, customer, company and gift items under their own sections.
