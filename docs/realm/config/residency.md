# `residency`

Redocly offers a choice of geographical locations for hosting.
Choose where your application resides when you set it up, then use this configuration setting for local tools to know where to connect to.

This option is needed if your projects have residency outside our main US-based location. For example, if you choose another geographical location such as Europe or self-host.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Legacy products" %}
Older Redocly products such as Workflows used the setting `region` with the value `eu` or `us`.
For new products, the `residency` configuration setting is used.
