# `requiresLogin`

{% configOptionRequirements products=$frontmatter.products plans=$frontmatter.plans /%}

{% $frontmatter.description %}
Only authenticated users, who are verified through either Redocly or an identity provider (IdP) you [added in Reunite](../reunite/organization/sso/add-idp.md) can access your project.

{% admonition type="info" %}
The **requiresLogin** option cannot be used in conjunction with the **rbac**.
These configurations are mutually exclusive.
{% /admonition %}
