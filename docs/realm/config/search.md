# `search`

{% configOptionRequirements products=$frontmatter.products plans=$frontmatter.plans /%}

Customize the search functionality in your project.
By default, search appears in the top navigation bar in the far right corner.

Use the `search` configuration to:

- hide the search bar
- add keyboard shortcuts for search activation
- add suggested pages to the search modal
- configure search facets for advanced filtering
- boost the ranking of pages for specific search terms
- prevent pages from appearing for specific search terms

{% partial file="../_partials/config/_supported-config.md" variables={"optionName": "search"} /%}

## Search engines

Redocly supports two types of search engines for your project:

1. **FlexSearch**: The default search engine that supports limited facets configuration.
   You can only adjust the [group facet](#group-facets).
2. **Typesense**: An advanced search engine with full facets configuration capabilities.
   Requires an Enterprise or Enterprise+ plan.

## Default search configuration

### Default categories

The default search configuration applies to all documents and includes two predefined search categories:

- **Documentation**: Includes all Markdown files present in the project.
- **API Reference**: All OpenAPI, GraphQL, AsyncAPI, and SOAP API definitions.

These categories are configured using the `redocly_category` facet field and are visible when you open the search dialog.

### Default facets

For search engines that support full facets configuration capabilities (Typesense), Redocly provides an additional filter panel featuring predefined facets:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  filters:
    facets:
      - name: Category
        field: redocly_category
        type: multi-select
      - name: HTTP Method
        field: httpMethod
        type: tags
      - name: HTTP Path
        field: httpPath
        type: multi-select
      - name: API Title
        field: apiTitle
        type: multi-select
      - name: API Version
        field: apiVersion
        type: select
```

**Data usage and privacy:** Curious how AI Search uses your data?
Redocly AI Search runs in **inference-only mode** and does not train or fine-tune AI models on your content.
For details, see the [AI Search data usage FAQ](../faq/ai-search-privacy.md).

{% admonition type="info" %}
AI search and Typesense search indexes are only built on the production branch.
Changes to search configuration or content exclusions, like the `excludeFromSearch` front matter option, may not immediately appear in search results until the next production build.
{% /admonition %}


## Apply facets to files

To apply facets to files, use metadata properties.
You can assign specific metadata to your files, such as custom facet fields for advanced filtering or predefined ones like `redocly_category` for grouping.

### Markdown files

Apply facets to Markdown files using front matter:

```yaml {% title="index.md" %}
---
metadata: 
  redocly_category: Custom 
  owner: Redocly
---
```

### OpenAPI definitions

Apply facets to OpenAPI definitions using the `x-metadata` extension:

```yaml {% title="museum.yaml" %}
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  version: 2.3.3
  title: Museum
  x-metadata:
    redocly_category: Custom
    owner: Redocly
```

### Use `metadataGlobs`

Use the `metadataGlobs` property in your `redocly.yaml` configuration file to apply facets to files using glob patterns:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
metadataGlobs:
  'museum/**':
    redocly_category: Museum
  'payments/**':
    redocly_category: Payments
```

## Group facets

The group facet categorizes search results and is displayed in the top panel of the search dialog for quick switching between categories.

{% admonition type="info" %}
Only `redocly_category` facet field is used as a group facet.
{% /admonition %}

## Curate search results

Influence the ranking of specific pages in search results for particular search terms.
Use `keywords` option in the front matter of a page or `x-keywords` in an OpenAPI description file to boost the page to the top of search results or exclude the page from appearing for certain keywords.

{% admonition type="info" %}
Curation is only available for the Typesense search engine, which requires an Enterprise or Enterprise+ plan.
{% /admonition %}

Behavior of pages with keywords:

- For each keyword in `includes`, the page is promoted to the top position in search results.
- If you use the same keyword in multiple pages, the pages appear at the top of search results in the order they were indexed by the search engine.
- Keywords are not case-sensitive.
- The word order in keywords is preserved: searching for "pay apple" won't trigger a keyword "apple pay".
- The first matching keyword triggers curation and stops additional keywords from being processed for that search.

### Curation parameters

Configure curation using the `keywords` object:

{% table %}

- Option
- Type
- Description

---

- includes
- [string]
- List of keywords or phrases that promote this page to the top of search results when these terms are used in the search query.

---

- excludes
- [string]
- List of keywords or phrases that prevent this page from appearing in search results when these terms are used in the search query.
  Overrides `includes` for the same keyword.

{% /table %}

### Apply curation to files

#### Markdown files

Apply curation to Markdown files using front matter:

```yaml {% title="payments.md" %}
---
keywords:
  includes:
    - apple pay
    - apple wallet
    - digital wallet
  excludes:
    - google pay
    - paypal
---
```

#### OpenAPI description files

Apply curation to OpenAPI definitions using the `x-keywords` extension.
You can apply curation at three different levels:

##### Description level

Apply curation to the root document of the API description.
The `includes` keywords boost the root document to the top of search results.
The `excludes` keywords remove the entire description file from search results for these terms.

```yaml {% title="payments.yaml" %}
openapi: 3.0.0
x-keywords:
  includes:
    - payment api
    - transaction
  excludes:
    - deprecated
info:
  version: 1.0.0
  title: Payment API
```

##### Tag level

Apply curation to a specific tag:

```yaml {% title="payments.yaml" %}
tags:
  - name: payments
    description: Payment operations
    x-keywords:
      includes:
        - wallet
        - checkout
      excludes:
        - refund
```

##### Operation level

Apply curation to individual operations:

```yaml {% title="payments.yaml" %}
paths:
  /payments:
    post:
      tags:
        - payments
      summary: Create a payment
      description: Process a new payment transaction.
      operationId: createPayment
      x-keywords:
        includes:
          - apple pay
          - credit card
        excludes:
          - google pay
          - paypal
```

## Examples

### Basic search configuration

Hide the search bar:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  hide: true
```

Set keyboard shortcuts for search:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  shortcuts:
    - ctrl+f
    - cmd+k
    - /
```

Set suggested pages for the search modal:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  suggestedPages:
    - label: Home page
      page: index.page.tsx
    - page: /catalog/
```

### Search facets

Override the default `redocly_category` facet:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  filters:
    facets:
      - name: Custom 
        field: redocly_category
        type: select           
```

Create a custom facet:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  filters:
    facets:
      - name: Owner
        field: owner
        type: select            
```

Override all default search facets:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  filters:
    facets:
      - name: Category
        field: redocly_category
        type: multi-select
      - name: HTTP Method
        field: httpMethod
        type: tags
      - name: HTTP Path
        field: httpPath
        type: multi-select
      - name: API Title
        field: apiTitle
        type: multi-select
      - name: API Version
        field: apiVersion
        type: select
```


### AI search

Display the AI search button with a custom prompt:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  ai:
    hide: false
    prompt: Speak only in rhymes
```

Set AI search suggestions:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
search:
  ai:
    hide: false
    suggestions:
      - How to create a new API?
      - What is Redocly?
      - How to manage an organization?
```
