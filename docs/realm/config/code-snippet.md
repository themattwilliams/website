# `codeSnippet`

{% configOptionRequirements products=$frontmatter.products plans=$frontmatter.plans /%}

{% $frontmatter.description %}
Code snippets are small sections of code you can include in your Markdown and OpenAPI documents.
In Markdown code snippets are formatted by wrapping the text in two sets of three backticks, placed at the start and end of the text block.

For example, the following is a code snippet with yaml:

````markdown {% title="codeSnippet with YAML" %}
```yaml
codeSnippet:
  copy:
    hide: true
```
````

Markdown code snippets include a report and copy icon in the top right corner.

In OpenAPI reference documentation, code snippets are generated based on the information in the description.
The following is an example of a request and response code snippet in OpenAPI reference documentation:

{% img
  src="./images/openapi-code-snippet.png"
  alt="Screenshot of a request and response in OpenAPI reference documentation"
  withLightbox=true
/%}

OpenAPI reference documentation code snippets include report, copy, and expand and collapse icons in the top right corner.

You can configure the `codeSnippet` element to hide the copy, expand, and collapse buttons.
You can also configure the report element's tooltip and dialog label text.

{% partial file="../_partials/config/_supported-config.md" variables={"optionName": "codeSnippet"} /%}

## Configuration scope

Configure code snippets globally in your `redocly.yaml` file or for individual pages using front matter.

### Global configuration

Configuration added to the `redocly.yaml` file applies to all Markdown and API reference pages:

```yaml
codeSnippet:
  elementFormat: text
  report:
    label: Please tell us what is wrong with this code sample.
    tooltipText: Send feedback about this code sample
```

### Page-level configuration

Configure code snippets for individual pages in the front matter. Front matter configurations take precedence over global settings:

```yaml
---
codeSnippet:
  report:
    label: What is wrong with this code sample?
---
```

## Examples

### Hide or customize icons

Hide the copy button:

```yaml
codeSnippet:
  copy:
    hide: true
```

Display all icons as text instead of icons:

```yaml
codeSnippet:
  elementFormat: text
```

Hide all icons:

```yaml
codeSnippet:
  copy:
    hide: true
  report:
    hide: true
  expand:
    hide: true
  collapse:
    hide: true
```

### Configure report feedback

Enable the report button with custom label and tooltip:

```yaml
codeSnippet:
  report:
    label: Please tell us what is wrong with this code sample.
    tooltipText: Send feedback about this code sample
```

### Hide expand and collapse buttons

Hide the expand and collapse buttons on JSON objects in OpenAPI reference documentation:

```yaml
codeSnippet:
  expand:
    hide: true
  collapse:
    hide: true
```
