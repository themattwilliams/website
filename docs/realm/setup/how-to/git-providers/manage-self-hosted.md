# Manage self-hosted Git providers

Connect your self-hosted source control to offer continuous validation and delivery of your APIs, reference documentation, and developer projects.
Define self-hosted Git providers on the organization level in Reunite.
After you add self-hosted Git providers to an organization, those providers become available for all users in the organization, making it possible to connect your repositories, or add remote content to Redocly projects.
You can add one or more Git self-hosted providers, depending on your infrastructure. Currently Reunite supports 2 types of self-hosted providers: GitLab self-managed and GitHub Enterprise Server.
