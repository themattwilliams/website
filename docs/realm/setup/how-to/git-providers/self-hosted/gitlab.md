{% admonition type="warning" %}
  Deleting a GitLab self-hosted provider instance removes all associated OAuth and personal access token authorization credentials, and stops synchronization for remote content and projects related to this provider.

  Perform this action only if you're certain your organization has no use for this GitLab self-hosted provider instance.
