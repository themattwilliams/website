# Add a sitemap

A [sitemap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map) is a resource that lists all the pages in your website to help search engines and other automation tools to identify all the pages available.

You can add a sitemap to your project in one of the following two ways:

- Configure your project to generate a sitemap (supported by all Redocly products).
- Create a custom sitemap and add it as a [static asset](../../author/concepts/static-assets.md).

## Generate a sitemap

When the `siteUrl` is set, Redocly will generate and host a sitemap file for your project at build time.
To enable the sitemap feature, add your site's domain to `siteUrl` in the `seo` section of your `redocly.yaml` configuration file, as shown in the following example:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
seo:
  siteUrl: https://docs.example.com
```

{% admonition type="info" name="No protected content" %}
  The generated sitemap **does not** include any pages protected by [role based access controls](rbac/index.md) or pages listed in the [ignore configuration](../../config/ignore.md).
{% /admonition %}

The data is formatted to standard search engine expectations, using the `<loc>` tag.
A snippet is shown below:

```xml {% title="docs.example.com/sitemap.xml" %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9" xmlns:news="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-news/0.9" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:image="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-image/1.1" xmlns:video="http://www.google.com/schemas/sitemap-video/1.1">
  <url>
    <loc>https://docs.example.com/</loc>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://docs.example.com/reference/</loc>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

### Page Priority


#### Default Priority

Redocly sets the optional `priority` property for pages in the generated `sitemap.xml` file to `0.5`, unless the pages are non-default versioned content.
For pages that are non-default versioned content pages, the optional `priority` property is set to `0.3` in the generated `sitemap.xml` file.
This distinction tells search engines the default version of content is more important than the non-default versions.

#### Set Priority in Markdown Files

Markdown files (`.md`) support priority configuration through front matter:

```md
---
seo:
  priority: 0.9
---

# Content here
```

#### Set Priority in React/TSX Files

React pages (`.tsx`) support priority configuration through a `frontmatter` export:

```tsx
export const frontmatter = {
  seo: {
    priority: 0.9
  }
};

export default function() {
  return (
    // Component content
  );
}
```

## Add a custom sitemap

Add a custom sitemap by placing a `sitemap.xml` file into the `/static` folder in the root of your project, as in the following example file tree:

```treeview {% title="Example file tree with sitemap.xml file" %}
your-awesome-project/
├── static/
│   └── sitemap.xml
├── guides/
├── redocly.yaml
└── ...
```

{% admonition type="warning" name="Validate your sitemap" %}
Redocly serves the sitemap but doesn't validate the structure, so you should validate your sitemap before adding the file.
{% /admonition %}

## View the sitemap

After enabling the sitemap or adding it as a static file, view your project's sitemap by navigating to `https://docs.example.com/sitemap.xml` in a [preview build](../../author/how-to/use-previews.md) or in production.
The sitemap is _not_ visible from a local preview after making the change.

When viewing the sitemap, some browsers show the raw XML while others render it in a nice structure.
However, this manual review step is just for verification.
Search engines only care about the data.

## Search engine considerations

More advanced sitemap configuration is possible using additional properties, such as `changefreq` and `lastmod`.
However, the sitemap generated by Redocly _does not_ include these.
You'll need to [add a custom sitemap](#add-a-custom-sitemap) to your project with those properties.

For best results with search engines, your project should also include a `robots.txt` file (see [Add a robots.txt file](./add-robots-file.md)) that provides an absolute URL to the hosted sitemap.
