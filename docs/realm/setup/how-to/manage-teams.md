# Manage teams

The **Teams** page is where you can manage teams.
If you are logged in to Reunite and have an [Owner organization role](../concepts/roles.md#organization-roles), you can view and manage teams from the **Teams** page in the following ways:

- create a new team
- add members to a team
- assign team managers
- demote team managers
- remove members from a team
- rename a team
- delete a team from your organization

Only users with an Owner organization role and members assigned as team managers can access the **Teams** page.
Team managers can only view and manage their assigned teams.

The **Team** page does not include options for determining who has access to projects.
Project access is determined by the permissions of the [teams](../concepts/teams.md) users are members of.
Team permissions are configured in the `redocly.yaml` file for each individual project.
See [Configure RBAC](./rbac/index.md) for more information.
