# Add remote content from a URL

Use the [remote content](../../concepts/remote-content.md) feature to include content from external sources in your project.
This approach is useful for including a single, publicly-available file as part of your published project.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following before you begin:

- [latest version of Realm](../realm-version.md)
- an existing Redocly project to add remote content to

## Add a remote URL source

To add content from a remote file:

1. In the file tree, select the folder (or click on the empty space to select the root directory) to which you want to add the remote content folder.
1. Select **+ > New remote folder > Add URL link**.
1. Enter name for the new remote content folder and press Enter or Return key.
1. Enter the URL of the publicly-available file to include in the project.
1. Enter the filename for this file in the Redocly project.
1. Select the appropriate Sync frequency, between 15 minutes and 12 hours.
   Files that update infrequently can be synced less often.
1. Select the [**Auto-sync**](../../concepts/remote-content.md#auto-sync-and-auto-merge) or [**Auto-merge**](../../concepts/remote-content.md#auto-sync-and-auto-merge) toggles to turn off either option.
1. Select **Add remote**.
   This action opens a pull request in Redocly automatically.
   After refreshing your browser, you should see a **View Pull Request** button next to your new branch name.

## Merge the open pull request in Redocly

After you enter the connection details in Redocly, a pull request to merge your updates with the default branch opens.

1. Refresh your browser to see a **View Pull Request** button next to your new branch name.
2. Select **View Pull Request**.
3. Review your updates in the **Review** tab.
4. After the tests have run and your pull request has been approved, click the **Merge** button to merge your updates with the default branch.
