# Add remote files with one-way sync

The [remote content](../../concepts/remote-content.md) feature allows adding content from a variety of external sources.
If you have files in a Git repository, you can include them as a remote content folder in your project.
Remote content folders are synced one way, so any updates pushed to your online Git repository are reflected in the Redocly project and can be deployed and published through Redocly.
