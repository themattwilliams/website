## Finish SSO configuration in Redocly

Go back to the Redocly SSO configuration screen that was opened earlier, and fill in the values from Microsoft Entra:

- **Single sign on URL**: Use the `Login URL` from the Microsoft Entra Single sign-on screen.
- **Issuer ID**: Use `Microsoft Entra Identifier` from the SAML SSO setup screen.
- **X509 Certificate**: Download the **Base64 Certificate** from the Microsoft Entra Single sign-on screen and paste the contents into this field.

Microsoft Entra doesn't send group names in the SAML response, so you may need to configure the team claim mapping
in order to use human-readable team names for RBAC.

To do this, you need to Select **Configure team claim mapping** checkbox and add the mapping from the group ID to the team name.

Select **Save** to finish the configuration.

## Optional. Verify a domain to enable SSO login into Redocly Reunite

To enable SSO for a specific project, add the `sso` section to the `redocly.yaml` file in the project repository.

sso:
  - CORPORATE # or GUEST
```

This change must be committed to the `main` branch to take effect.

See the [sso reference](../../config/sso.md) for more details.

```yaml
rbac:
  content:
    '**':
      anonymous: none
      authenticated: read

    apis/Team A/**:
      authenticated: read
      TeamA_member: maintain
      TeamA_owner: admin

    apis/Team B/**:
      authenticated: read
      TeamB_member: maintain
      Team_B_owner: admin
```
