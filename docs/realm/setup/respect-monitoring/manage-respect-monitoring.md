# Manage Respect Monitoring

You can subscribe to notifications by Arazzo workflow, to receive a message when an API included in the Arazzo workflow does not pass the criteria checks.
You can also archive old workflows, so they do not clutter the Respect Monitoring page, allowing you to focus on active workflows.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following before you begin:

- Realm [owner organization role](../concepts/roles.md)
- If you are configuring Slack notifications:
  - Slack Workspace owner permissions
  - The name of the public channel you plan to use
- [Arazzo Description](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/latest.html) in project
- A [`job`](../../config/reunite.md#jobs-object) configuration in your `redocly.yaml` file

## Subscribe to notifications

Get Respect Monitoring incident updates and maintenance status updates sent directly to you.
You can select what severity level events you want reported in the notifications.
You can subscribe to Slack or email notifications.
