# SOAP API docs plugin

Render SOAP documentation in a project. This plugin uses a <a href="https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap" target="_blank">SOAP library</a> to generate documentation from your WSDL files.

This is a plugin reference page. A setup guide can be found in the [How-to section](../../../../author/how-to/add-soap-docs.md)

## NPM package

`@redocly/portal-plugin-soap-api`

## Introduction

When you add this plugin to your project, it automatically detects WSDL specification files and includes them as SOAP documentation pages.
To be recognized, the specification files must have a `.wsdl` extension.
