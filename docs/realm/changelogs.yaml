          Fixed an issue where identical Markdown headings across different tag descriptions created sidebar entries with the same URL, causing UI
          jumping issues. This fix adds tag ID prefixing to heading IDs, ensuring each heading gets a unique URL based on its tag.
        - Fixed an issue where an OpenAPI page would jump unexpectedly while scrolling.
