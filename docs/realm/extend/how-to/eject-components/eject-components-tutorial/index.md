  ## Eject components tutorial

  ### Update tabs component behavior

  Let's imagine you are writing a tutorial describing how to write code to work with your product.
  You decided to use Redocly's [tabs](https://redocly.com/learn/markdoc/tags/tabs) Markdoc tag to show code examples in different languages.
  As you are working, you decide it would be nice if a user could select their preferred programming language once triggering the update of all other tabs on the page to the selected programming language.

  But you notice, the Redocly [tabs](https://redocly.com/learn/markdoc/tags/tabs) Markdoc tag, does not have the ability to configure syncing between tabs.
  So you decide to eject the component to update the behavior to allow configuring syncing between tabs.

  {% img
    alt="Tabs without syncing"
    src="./images/tabs-without-syncing.png"
    height=200
    withLightbox=true
    align="center"
  /%}

  ### Eject the tabs component in Reunite

  For this tutorial we are going to eject the component using the [Reunite editor](../eject-components-in-reunite.md).
  To eject the component using the Reunite editor:

  1. Select **Editor** on the left side navigation.
  1. Click the **Theme components** in the **Files** section.
  1. Search for **tabs**.
  1. Find the **Tabs.tsx** component and click the eject icon.

  {% img
    alt="Eject tabs component"
    src="./images/eject-tabs-component.png"
    height=400
    withLightbox=true
  /%}

  After ejecting, the component is added to the `@theme` folder at the path `@theme/markdoc/components/Tabs/Tabs.tsx` where we can modify it.

  ### Implement `useTabs` hook

  {% step id="implement-useTabs-hook" %}
    Create a new `useTabs.ts` file adjacent to the `Tabs.tsx` file and copy the code from the example.
    You can also download all examples and drag and drop them to the `@theme/markdoc/components/Tabs` folder.

    This custom hook reuses the original `useTabs` hook and adds syncing functionality between tabs with the same `syncId`.
    It stores the `activeTab` state in `localStorage` after an update was triggered, and all other tabs are subscribed to the storage events to update their state.
    Also, for initial mount, it gets the `activeTab` from `localStorage` to preserve the tabs state even after a page is reloaded.

    {% admonition type="info" %}
      This tutorial does not provide step-by-step instructions for every customization. Each case is unique and requires a different approach. React, Markdoc and TypeScript knowledge is required to customize it.
    {% /admonition %}
  {% /step %}

  ### Replace the `useTabs` hook inside the Tabs component

  {% step id="replace-useTabs-hook-import" heading="Replace useTabs hook import" %}
    Replace the original `useTabs` hook import with the custom hook.
  {% /step %}

  {% step id="extend-TabsProps-interface" heading="Extend TabsProps interface" %}
    Extend the `TabsProps` interface to include the `syncId` prop.
  {% /step %}

  {% step id="add-syncId-prop" heading="Add syncId prop to the Tabs component" %}
    Add the `syncId` prop to the `Tabs` component.
  {% /step %}

  {% step id="pass-syncId-to-useTabs-hook" heading="Pass syncId to the useTabs hook" %}
    And finally, pass the `syncId` prop to the `useTabs` hook.
  {% /step %}

  ### Extend the tabs Markdoc schema

  We also need to update the tabs interface to be able to pass the `syncId` prop to the `tabs` Markdoc component, which passes the `syncId` to our modified `Tabs` React component.

  #### Eject the tags Markdoc schema

  1. Select **Editor** on the left side navigation.
  1. Click the **Theme components** in the **Files** section.
  1. Search for **tabs**.
  1. Find the **tabs.ts** tag and click the eject icon.

  {% step id="add-syncId-markdoc-attribute" heading="Add syncId markdoc attribute" %}
    Add the `syncId` Markdoc attribute to the `tabs` tag.
  {% /step %}

  {% step id="add-custom-schema" heading="Fix \"invalid attribute: 'syncId'\" warning" %}
    To fix a warning, let's redefine our Markdoc schema. Create a new `schema.ts` inside the `@theme/markdoc` folder and copy the code from the example.
  {% /step %}

  ### Create a tutorial page

  {% step id="tutorial-code-snippet" heading="Create tutorial page" %}
    To test our changes, let's create a `tutorial.md` page in the root of the project and copy the code from the example.

    Your file structure should look like this:

    ```treeview {% title="Example of ejected components and a tutorial page" %}
    ├── @theme/
    │   └── markdoc/
    │       ├── components/
    │       │   └── Tabs/
    │       │       ├── Tabs.tsx
    │       │       └── useTabs.ts
    │       ├── tags/
    │       │   └── tabs.ts
    │       └── schema.ts
    └── tutorial.md
    ```
  {% /step %}

  {% step id="add-syncId-attribute" heading="Add syncId attribute" %}
    Since we added `syncId` attributes to the `tabs` tags, we can sync the tabs state between those tabs with the same `syncId`.
  {% /step %}

  Test it out. Do the tabs sync?

  ### 🎉 Congratulations

  You have successfully ejected the `Tabs` component and added custom functionality to it.
  Don't forget, with great power comes great responsibility, now you are responsible for maintaining the component 😉.
