# Add AsyncAPI documents

Transform your AsyncAPI document files into reference documentation by integrating them into your project.
Give your users the tools they need to make the most of your Event-Driven APIs (EDAs) with comprehensive reference documentation.
Either add individual document files to your project alongside your other content, or use an [API catalog](./add-catalog.md) to showcase your EDAs alongside OpenAPI and AsyncAPI APIs.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following before you begin:

- a `redocly.yaml` file in the root of your project
- a `package.json` file in the root of your project
- the Redocly package for the product you use (such as `@redocly/realm`) listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file

{% admonition type="warning" name="Local dependencies required" %}
Redocly projects can be previewed locally without installing dependencies, but to add the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin, you must have both Realm and the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin installed as local dependencies.

If you see the error `Theme "@redocly/portal-plugin-async-api" not found`, check that you have the `@redocly/realm` package listed in `package.json`.
{% /admonition %}

## Install the Redocly Async API plugin

To generate reference documentation for AsyncAPI document files, you must have the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin installed in your project.
If you are working locally, install the plugin using a package manager.
If you are working in Reunite, add the plugin as a dependency to your `package.json` file.

### Install in Reunite

To generate Event-Driven API reference documentation from an AsyncAPI document file, add a `package.json` file with the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin listed as a dependency.

Use the following example `package.json` file that includes the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin as a dependency, updating `*` with the [latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@redocly/portal-plugin-async-api):

```json {% title="package.json" %}
{
  "name": "demo project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "description": "demo",
  "dependencies": {
    "@redocly/portal-plugin-async-api": "*"
  }
}
```

### Install using a package manager

Redocly projects can be previewed locally without installing dependencies, but to add the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin, you must have both the Realm and the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin installed as local dependencies.

To install the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin, use one of the following commands, depending on the package manager you are using:

{% tabs %}

{% tab label="npm" %}
```sh {% title="npm" %}
npm install @redocly/portal-plugin-async-api
```
{% /tab %}

{% tab label="yarn" %}

```sh {% title="yarn" %}
yarn add @redocly/portal-plugin-async-api
```

{% /tab %}

{% tab label="pnpm" %}

```sh {% title="pnpm" %}
pnpm add @redocly/portal-plugin-async-api
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

### Enable plugin in redocly.yaml

After you have installed the plugin in your project, you must also enable it in your `redocly.yaml` file by adding it to the `plugins` object.

To enable the Redocly AsyncAPI plugin in your project, add the following configuration to your `redocly.yaml` file at the root of your project:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
plugins:
  - '@redocly/portal-plugin-async-api/plugin.js'
```

For a complete plugin settings reference see [AsyncAPI plugin reference](../../setup/reference/plugins/docs/asyncapi.md#configuration).

## Add the AsyncAPI document file to your project

If you only have one or two AsyncAPI document files, and you do not have a `sidebars.yaml` file in your project, to add Event-Driven API (EDA) documentation to your project, place the files in your project, either at the root or in a folder.
Afterwards, the EDA reference documentation is automatically added to your sidebar when you run your project.

If you do not have one yet, you can use one of the example files from [AsyncAPI github repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/tree/master/examples).

If you have a `sidebars.yaml` file in your project, adding your AsyncAPI document file to your project does not add it to your sidebar automatically.
You must add your AsyncAPI document file to your `sidebars.yaml` file.

## Use the sidebars.yaml file

If you have a `sidebars.yaml` file in your project, you must add any files, including AsyncAPI document files, you want displayed in your sidebar to it.
For more information on configuring a `sidebars.yaml` file for your project, see [Configure navigation on the sidebar](./configure-nav/sidebar.md).

To add an AsyncAPI document file to your project with a `sidebars.yaml` file, add the `page` and `label` keys with the corresponding values for the AsyncAPI document file to your `sidebars.yaml` file, as in the following example:

```yaml {% title="sidebars.yaml" %}
- page: apis/sample-api.yaml
  label: Sample API
```

If you have multiple API documents, you can group them to better organize your sidebar navigation menu.

### Use the `group` key for multiple descriptions

If you have multiple AsyncAPI document files, you can use a `group` key for each so that the different endpoints are only revealed when selected.

To add multiple AsyncAPI document files using `group` keys, update your `sidebars.yaml` file, as in the following example:

```yaml
- group: Sample product 1 API
  items:
    - page: apis/sample-api-1.yaml
      label: Sample product 1 API
- group: Sample product 2 API
  items:
    - page: apis/sample-product-2.yaml
      label: Sample product 2 API
```
