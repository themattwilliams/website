# OpenAPI extension: `x-nullable`

{% admonition type="warning" name="Compatibility warning" %}

This specification extension is supported only in OpenAPI 2.0.
In OpenAPI 3.0, use `nullable`.
In OpenAPI 3.1, use an array of types and include `null` in the list.

Use `x-nullable` in your OpenAPI 2.0 documents to mark schemas with the label `Nullable` in the API documentation. This indicates that the value of a particular property may be `null`. Add it to the `schema` OpenAPI object.

schemas:
  country:
    type: string
    description: Country of origin
    x-nullable: true
```
