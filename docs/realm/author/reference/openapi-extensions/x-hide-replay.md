# OpenAPI extension: `x-hideReplay`

Replay lets users make API request from your documentation, to quickly and easily try the experience.
Use `x-hideReplay` to turn off replay for one operation, removing the "Try It" button.

## Location

Use the `x-hideReplay` extension in an Operation declaration.

## Options

{% table %}

* Option
* Type
* Description

---

* x-hideReplay
* boolean
* Hides the Replay for the operation on which it was set to `true`.

{% /table %}

## Examples

The following example shows how to disable Replay on the `ExamplePath` operation.

```yaml
paths:
  /example:
    get:
      summary: Example operation
      description: Example description
      operationId: examplePath
      responses: [...]
      parameters: [...]
      x-hideReplay: true
```

This operation will have complete documentation, but without interactive features.
