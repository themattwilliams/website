## Dynamic values in translations

Translations use template syntax with placeholders like `{{value}}` to enable dynamic content generation. This templating mechanism allows the application to inject variable data at runtime, producing contextually appropriate text without requiring separate translation entries for each possible value.

For example, the `time.past.seconds` translation key uses `{{value}}` to represent the number of seconds. Instead of creating separate translation keys for each possible number of seconds in a minute, the application automatically inserts the correct number at runtime:

```md
"{{value}} seconds ago" → "5 seconds ago", "42 seconds ago", etc.
```

When creating or modifying translations with dynamic values, always preserve these placeholders in your text.

## Resources

* Configure language support for your project by following the steps in the [Configure localization](../../author/how-to/config-l10n/index.md) how-to documentation.
