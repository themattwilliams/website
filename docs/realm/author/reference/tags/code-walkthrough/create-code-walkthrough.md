# Create code walkthrough

The code walkthrough feature is an authoring tool for creating dynamic, interactive guides that manage user's focus as they scroll.

In a code walkthrough, content is displayed across two distinct panels.
The panels are side-by-side, but each serves a different purpose.

- The **left panel** displays steps and explanations that guide users through the code examples shown on the right panel.
This content is created using Markdown and multiple [Markdoc tags](./index.md).

- The **right panel** displays code examples and highlights the specific section of code related to the current step in the left panel.
Highlights are managed using [chunk](./index.md#chunk-annotations) annotations in the example code.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have the following before you begin:

- example code files you plan to use
- a `redocly.yaml` file at the root of your project

## Organize content

Add code examples to your project as individual files.
Redocly recommends storing the code walkthrough's example files together in the same folder, as in the following example:

```treeview {% title="Example project structure" %}
your-awesome-project/
├── create-web-page/
│   ├── _filesets/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── styles.css
│   │   ├── scripts.js
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── index.md
├── ...
└── redocly.yaml
```

The reason we recommend storing all example files together is so that you can [ignore](https://redocly.com/docs/realm/config/ignore) them in the project configuration.

## Ignore example files

Exclude code example files from the project build using the `ignore` configuration in your `redocly.yaml` file.
This exclusion prevents code examples from being parsed as content, ensuring they behave only as a data source for a code walkthrough.

Ignore files individually or as a folder, as in the following example:

```yaml {% title="redocly.yaml" %}
ignore:
  # Ignore folder and all files in it
  - '**/_filesets/**/*'
```
After adding and ignoring the code example files, you're ready to add a code walkthrough to a Markdown page.

## Add a code walkthrough

Before writing content, use the [code-walkthrough tags](./index.md) to render a basic code walkthrough showing a single example code file and minimal content.

This step ensures the code examples are configured correctly, making it easier to spot errors when creating code walkthrough content.

Add the `code-walkthrough` tag referencing one of your example code files, as in the following example:

```markdoc {% process=false title="create-web-page/index.md" %}
<!-- ...other markup... -->
{% code-walkthrough
  filesets=[
    { "files": [ "examples/index.html"] }
  ]
%}
  # Code Walkthrough

  Code walkthrough content goes here.
{% /code-walkthrough %}
```

{% img withLightbox=true alt="A screenshot of the project using a single file and the smallest required configuration" src="../images/minimal-codewalkthrough.png" /%}

Restart the development preview and look at the page to verify the code walkthrough rendered successfully.
You should see a side-by-side panel render on the page showing the code example.

## Add files and categories

Complete any remaining configuration of the `code-walkthrough` tag, which may include the following tasks:

- Add more code example `files`.
- Organize content using `filters`.
- Include "download-only" files using `downloadAssociatedFiles`.

The following example includes multiple example files, a filter, and download-only files:

```markdoc {% process=false title="create-web-page/index.md" %}
{% code-walkthrough
  filesets=[
    { 
      "files": ["./code-samples/go/server.go"],
      "downloadAssociatedFiles": ["./code-samples/go/*"],
      "when": { "backend": "Go" }
    },
    { 
      "files": ["./code-samples/node/server.js"],
      "downloadAssociatedFiles": ["./code-samples/node/*"],
      "when": { "backend": "Node" }
    },
    { 
      "files": ["./code-samples/python/server.py"],
      "downloadAssociatedFiles": ["./code-samples/python/*"],
      "when": { "backend": "Python" }
    }
  ],
  filters={
    "backend": {
      "label": "Backend",
      "items": [
        { "value": "Go" },
        { "value": "Node" },
        { "value": "Python" },
      ],
    }
  }
%}
  # Code Walkthrough

  Code walkthrough content goes here.
{% /code-walkthrough %}
```
{% img withLightbox=true alt="A screenshot of the project using multiple example files, a group label, and a download-only file" src="../images/advanced-codewalkthrough.png" /%}

Verify the following behaviors in your walkthrough before writing content:

- Filenames for a code example show at top of right panel.
- Clicking a filename changes the code in right panel.
- (Optional) `filesets` and `filters` configured to add any user-facing filters.

## Add steps for left panel

Define a section in the left panel by wrapping content with the `step` tag.
Each step must have a unique `id`.

As the user scrolls, the "active step" changes and applies custom styling to that section of content.

The following example shows how steps are used in a walkthrough:

```markdoc {% process=false title="create-web-page/index.md" %}
{% code-walkthrough ... %}
  <!-- ...other steps and content -->
  ## Define document head

  {% step id="head-tag" heading="Add head tag" %}
    Add a `<head>` tag to the `index.html` file.
  {% /step %}

  ## Add elements to head

  {% step id="page-title" heading="Set page title" %}
    Use the `<title>` tag to set the title of your page.
  {% /step %}

  {% step id="link-css" heading="Link CSS styles" %}
    Use the `<link>` tag to import custom styling.
  {% /step %}
  <!-- ...other steps and content -->
{% /code-walkthrough %}
```

## Chunks for right panel

Use [chunks annotation](./index.md#chunk-annotations) to control which lines are highlighted in the right panel when a step becomes active in a code walkthrough.

Define a section in the right panel by wrapping part of the code example with `redocly-chunk` annotations.
Use the `steps` attribute to connect that section of code with specific steps.

As the user scrolls, the chunk is highlighted when the corresponding step(s) become active.

The following example shows chunk annotations used in a walkthrough's code example:

```html {% title="create-web-page/examples/index.html" %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<!-- @chunk {"steps": ["head-tag"]} -->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- @chunk {"steps": ["page-title"]} -->
    <title>Walkthrough example</title>
    <!-- @chunk-end -->
     <!-- @chunk {"steps": ["link-css"]} -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="static/styles.css">
    <!-- @chunk-end -->
</head>
<!-- @chunk-end -->
<!-- ...other content... -->
</html>
```

## Content authoring flow

The code walkthrough feature is a tool for managing user focus, where the author is responsible for the _experience_ of the end-user.

Use the following authoring flow when creating walkthrough content:

1. Write the step (left panel).
2. Define the chunk (right panel).
3. In preview, verify highlight behavior when step is active.
4. Start again from step **1**.

This approach helps reduce complexity for authors and leads to higher quality walkthroughs.

## Resources

- Use [code walkthrough tags](./index.md) to manage the content in the left panel.
- Control the highlighting behavior of code examples with [chunk annotations](./index.md#chunk-annotations).
