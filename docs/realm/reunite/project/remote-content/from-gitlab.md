# Add remote files from GitLab

If your project files are stored in a remote repository on GitLab, you can connect that repository, so you can access and publish those files in Redocly.

To connect a GitLab repository, you must first create a new access token in GitLab.
Afterward, you must create a new branch, enter the connection details, and merge the open pull request in Reunite.

## Create a new access token in GitLab

{% partial file="../../../_partials/create-access-token-gl.md" /%}

## Create a new branch in Reunite

{% partial file="../../../_partials/create-branch.md" /%}

## Enter the connection details in Reunite

After you have created a new branch in Reunite, you can add remote content to your project in Reunite using the connection details you have collected from GitLab.

To enter the connection details in Reunite:

1. In the file tree, select the folder (or click on the empty space to select the root directory) where you want to add the remote content.
1. Select **+ > New remote folder > Add Git repository** to add a remote content folder, or **+ > New remote file > Add Git repository** to add a remote content file.
1. Enter a name for the new remote content (folder or file) and press the Enter or Return key.
1. From the list of Git providers, select **GitLab** or a self-managed GitLab instance.
1. Enter a **Credential name** for the new GitLab credential.
1. Enter the **Access token** you saved from the [Create a new access token in GitLab](#create-a-new-access-token-in-gitlab) step and select **Next**.
1. Select the **Namespace > Project > Branch**.
1. (Optional) Select the [**Folder**](./remote-content.md#remote-contents-repository-folder) or [**File**](./remote-content.md#remote-contents-repository-file), depending on whether you are adding a remote folder or a remote file.
1. (Optional) Select the [**Auto-sync**](./remote-content.md#auto-sync-and-auto-merge) or [**Auto-merge**](./remote-content.md#auto-sync-and-auto-merge) toggles to turn off either option.
1. Select **Add remote**.
   This action opens a pull request in Reunite automatically.

You can click the **View Pull Request** button next to your new branch name to view the pull request.


## Merge the open pull request in Reunite

After you enter the connection details in Redocly, a pull request to merge your updates with the default branch opens.
When you merge the pull request your changes are added to your main branch and a production deploy is triggered.

To merge the open pull request in Reunite:

1. Select the **View Pull Request** button next to your branch name.
1. Review your updates in the **Review** tab.
1. After the tests have run and your pull request has been approved, click the **Merge** button to merge your updates with the default branch.
