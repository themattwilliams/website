# Review a pull request in Reunite

Select a pull request from the list on the **Pull requests** page and click the **Review** tab to begin your review.

You cannot review a pull request if you authored it.

## Review visual and code diff

The **Review** tab opens with the **Visual** view by default, showing rendered pages before and after updates for visual comparison.

Click **Code** on the toggle to view the Markdown diff instead.
For multi-page updates, select different pages from the sidebar navigation to review each one.

Use the file tree filter on the left to find specific pages.

## Add comments to reviews

Add feedback as comments in either visual or code diff views.

To add comments in the visual or code diff view:

1. Click the comments icon on the right side.

    {% img
      src="../../images/comment-icon.png"
      alt="Screenshot of top right side of review tab in Reunite with arrow pointing to the comments icon"
      withLightbox=true
    /%}

1. Enter your feedback.
1. Click **Comment**.

To add line-specific comments in code diff view:

1. Hover over the line numbers.
1. Click the plus icon.

    {% img
      src="../../images/plus-icon.png"
      alt="Screenshot of code diff view in Reunite with arrow pointing towards plus icon"
      withLightbox=true
    /%}

1. Enter your feedback.
1. Select one option:
   - **Add a single comment**: For a standalone comment.
   - **Start a review**: For multiple comments in a complete review.

Use the text field toolbar to format text, add links, or insert images.
Mention people or teams with the `@` symbol followed by their name.

## Approve or request changes

After reviewing the pull request, click the **Review** button, add your final thoughts, and select one option:

- **Comment:** Provide feedback without explicit approval or rejection.
- **Approve:** Indicate the pull request is ready to merge.
- **Request changes:** Specify issues that require resolution before approval.

Format your review comment using the toolbar options, then click **Submit review**.

After the review is submitted, if your project uses a [connected Git provider](../../project/connect-git/connect-git-provider.md) (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, or Bitbucket), you will see a **Visual review** check on it.

The check links back to the **Visual review** tab in Reunite and displays a short status (for example, **Pending**, **Approved**, **Changes requested**, or **No changes**).

**Visual review** check updates automatically when you add comments or change a review in Reunite.

If you also connected your Git provider and Reunite accounts before submitting your review, it will post a review to your Git repository.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Review posting behavior" %}
If your accounts are connected but you do not have review permissions in the provider, your review appears in Reunite only and is never posted to the provider.
{% /admonition %}

## Merge a pull request

After a **Ready for review** pull request receives approval and passes checks, click **Merge**.

{% admonition type="warning" name="Emergency merge process" %}
Check **Merge without requirements** only for urgent changes when you're certain they won't cause build issues.
{% /admonition %}

After merging, the updates appear in the main branch and trigger a deployment to publish changes to the production project.
