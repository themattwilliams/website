# Teams

Teams are groups of users that form an important part of configuring [role-based access control (RBAC)](../../access/rbac.md) for your projects.
You can assign users to more than one team and manage team composition to control project access.

## Team management modes

Teams can be managed in two different ways depending on your authentication setup:

**Identity Provider Managed Teams (SSO):**
- Teams are imported and synchronized from your identity provider
- Team membership is controlled by your identity provider (e.g., Active Directory groups)
- **Cannot be managed through the Reunite Teams page** - changes must be made in your identity provider
- Team assignments from SSO **override** any manual team assignments in Reunite

**Reunite Managed Teams:**
- Teams are created and managed directly in Reunite
- Team membership is controlled through the [Reunite Teams page](#manage-teams)
- Full control over team composition, managers, and team names within Reunite

{% admonition type="info" %}

Team names used in the [team mapping single sign-on settings](./sso/add-idp.md#team-mapping) or added in Reunite **must** match the names listed in the `rbac` configuration in your `redocly.yaml` file for the permissions to be granted.

{% /admonition %}

Add users to teams in one of the following ways:

- [Import teams with your SSO identity provider](./sso/add-idp.md#team-mapping) (identity provider managed)
- [Assign users to teams with an invitation](./manage-people.md#invite-people) (Reunite managed)
- [Add users to teams in Reunite](#add-members-to-a-team) (Reunite managed)

## Default teams

Redocly provides built-in teams that are applied to users automatically:

- `authenticated`: Assigned to all authenticated users in addition to teams assigned from the IdP (identity provider)
- `anonymous`: Assigned to all unauthenticated users

Without a `rbac` configuration, `authenticated` and `anonymous` teams do not influence resource access.
These default teams are useful when you do not need granular permissions and only want to restrict access to unauthenticated users.

For example, the following `rbac` configuration allows users in the `authenticated` team `read` access to all files in a project:

```yaml
rbac:
  content:
    '**':
       authenticated: read
```

{% admonition type="warning" %}
The `authenticated` and `anonymous` names are reserved team names.
If you define a team with the same name in the `redocly.yaml` file, it won't work as expected.
{% /admonition %}

### Organization role teams

Redocly also includes built-in teams based on organization roles in Reunite:

- `redocly.owners`: Assigned to all users with the owner organization role
- `redocly.members`: Assigned to all users with the member organization role
- `redocly.viewers`: Assigned to all users with the viewer organization role
- `redocly.billing`: Assigned to all users with the billing organization role

These teams are useful when adding an identity provider (IdP) in Reunite.
You have the option when adding an IdP to configure team mapping.
Team mapping connects groups in your IdP to RBAC teams in Reunite.
When users log in with an IdP, the groups assigned in the IdP override the RBAC teams assigned in Reunite.
See the SSO concept documentation for more information on [team mapping](./sso/sso.md#team-mapping).

## Multiple teams

If users belong to multiple teams, they have the combination of the roles assigned to their teams.

For example, the following configuration defines the `Developers` team with the `write` role and the `authenticated` team with the `read` role for the `**` scope.

```yaml
rbac:
  reunite:
    anonymous: read
    authenticated: read
    Developers: write
  content:
    '**':
      anonymous: read
      authenticated: read
      Developers: write
    docs/**/*.md:
      Developers: read
      authenticated: read
```

As a result, users in both the `Developers` and `authenticated` teams have `write` role permissions for the other resources, but only `read` role permissions for the `docs/**/*.md` resources.

## Team managers

Users with the Owner organization role can assign users as team managers.
Team managers help reduce the number of Owner roles needed in your organization.

Only users with the Owner and Member organization roles can be team managers.
Manager privileges are indicated by a tag on the team page.
Managers are optional for teams and there is no limit to the number of managers in a team.

Team managers can:

- View the teams they manage
- View, add, or remove users within their teams
- Update the team name

## Manage teams

If you are logged in to Reunite and have an [Owner organization role](../../access/roles.md#organization-roles), you can view and manage **Reunite-managed teams** from the **Teams** page in the following ways:

- Create a new team
- Add members to a team
- Assign team managers
- Demote team managers
- Remove members from a team
- Rename a team
- Delete a team from your organization

{% admonition type="warning" %}
**Identity provider managed teams cannot be edited** through the Teams page.
If a team is imported from your identity provider, you must make changes to team membership and composition in your identity provider system (e.g., Active Directory, Okta, etc.).
{% /admonition %}

Only users with an Owner organization role and members assigned as team managers can access the **Teams** page.
Team managers can only view and manage their assigned teams.

The **Teams** page does not include options for determining who has access to projects.
Project access is determined by the permissions of the teams users are members of.
Team permissions are configured in the `redocly.yaml` file for each individual project.
See [Configure RBAC](../../access/index.md) for more information.

### Create a new team

You can create a new team to organize users or in preparation for setting up RBAC.
