# Product changes

There are some changes to our products lineup as we bring out the next generation of tools.
This page is a quick reference for the key information related to these changes.

## New products

New products go beyond documentation and bring next-level API showcase and developer platform features into your projects.

### Upgrade choices

Users of Workflows are recommended to migrate to Redoc.

For users of the beta version of the Developer Portal, consider Revel with Redoc, or Realm.

### How to migrate

We’ve prepared detailed migration guides for our two major products. These guides are technical and designed to help you transition smoothly:
- [API docs Migration Guide](../../docs/realm/get-started/index.md)
- [Developer Portal (Gatsby Portal) Migration Guide](../../docs/realm/get-started/index.md)

### Future products

We have more products that haven't been released yet.
All our tools integrate well with one another, and since they are based on open standards, you can combine them with any other tools you choose.

To keep "in the loop" with all our updates, [subscribe to our product updates newsletter](../product-updates).

## Key dates

For most customers, your current product (including Workflows, API Reference, and Developer Portal projects) is supported until February 28th, 2026.

## Open source

Our open source projects are unchanged. Those products are:

- [Redoc](../../docs/redoc/index.md), open source API reference documentation (separate from the commercial hosted Redoc product that also provides API reference documentation).
  Expect to see updates to the open source project in the coming months.

- [Redocly CLI](../../docs/cli), your open source multitool for all your API needs.
